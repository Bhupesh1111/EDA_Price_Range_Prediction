# EDA_Price_Range_Prediction
In the competitive mobile phone market companies want
to understand sales data of mobile phones and factors which drive the prices.
The objective is to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,
Internal Memory, etc) and its selling price. In this problem, we do not have to predict the
actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.
The Mobile Price Range Prediction Machine Learning (ML) model is designed to estimate the price category of mobile phones based on a set of features. This model is valuable for both consumers looking to make informed purchasing decisions and mobile manufacturers seeking to optimize pricing strategies.
